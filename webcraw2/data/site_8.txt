Yesterday I saw the Corot exhibition.
1 It included a painting of the ‘Mount of Olives’; 2 I’m glad he painted that.
On the right, a group of olive trees, dark against the darkening blue sky; in the background hills covered with shrubs and a couple of tall trees, above them the evening star.
There are 3 Corots at the Salon, very beautiful, the most beautiful one, painted shortly before his death, ‘Women cutting wood’, will probably appear as a woodcut in L’Illustration or Le Monde Illustré.
3 I’ve also seen the Louvre and the Luxembourg, as you can imagine.
The Ruisdael s in the Louvre are magnificent, especially ‘The bush’, ‘The breakwater’ and ‘The ray of sunlight’.
4 1r:2 I wish you could see the small Rembrandt s there, the ‘Supper at Emmaus’, 5 and two pendants, ‘The philosophers’.
6 I recently saw Jules Breton with his wife and two daughters.
7 Physically he reminded me of J. Maris , though he has dark hair.
When I have the chance I’ll send you a book of his, ‘Les champs et la mer’, which contains all his poems.
8 He has a beautiful painting at the Salon, ‘The feast of St John’, peasant girls dancing on a summer evening round the St John’s bonfire, in the background the village with its church and the moon above it.
9 Dance, young maidens, dance, As you sing your songs of love!
Tomorrow, at break of day, You’ll go, hastening to ply your sickles.
10 There are now 3 paintings by him in the Luxembourg.
‘Procession through a cornfield’, ‘Women gleaning’ and ‘Alone’.

On 29 April 1858, Jules Breton married Elodie Breton-De Vigne , the daughter of Breton’s former teacher Félix De Vigne .
Contrary to what Van Gogh thought, they had but one daughter, Virginie , who was also Breton’s only pupil.
She grew up with her cousin Julie, whom Van Gogh had presumably taken to be a daughter of Breton.
