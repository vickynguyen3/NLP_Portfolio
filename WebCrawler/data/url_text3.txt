[endif] logly_body_begin hard to imagine legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki needing to be any more lauded than he already is.
Over 95 percent of population has watched one of his movies, people see uploading his films to the Internet as being the fast track to popularity, and even got a celestial body named after him .
Really, though, after seeing the quality of his work, hard to argue with the respect he receives.
The man is clearly a genius.
However, Miyazaki is also a 73-year-old man, and like many individuals who have reached such an age, occasionally resist the stubborn urge to grumble about how the people who came up after him are screwing up his industry .
A series of screen captures from an interview given by Miyazaki was recently posted on Japanese website Golden Times.
In the images, we see the director working on a drawing of a young girl, of course with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth beginning to suspect the smokes are some sort of growth that protrudes from mouth, given the rarity of seeing him without one).
As he sketches, Miyazaki expounds on why able to do the things he does.
see, whether you can draw like this or not, being able to think up this kind of design, it depends on whether or not you can say to yourself, yeah, girls like this exist in real you spend time watching real people, you do this, because never seen people spend their lives interested only in all Japanese animation is produced with hardly any basis taken from observing real people, you produced by humans who stand looking at other why the industry is full of otaku!
On one hand, it seems a little obvious that animation studios would largely be staffed by the people known as otaku , given that the term, in its most commonly used unqualified form, generally refers to people who really like anime .
In other news, boxing is full of dudes who really like punching stuff.
At the same time, hard to argue with criticism of otaku in relation to the more pejorative connotation the word holds, that of a person lacking in social breadth and well-rounded life experiences.
Given the way in which his characters have been striking chords with audiences for decades, the famed derision of many other inability to properly project human elements in animation definitely has some credibility behind it.
So if your dream is to be the next big thing in the anime industry, it might be in your best interest to get out of the house a little more.
Feel free to take your sketchbook with you.
