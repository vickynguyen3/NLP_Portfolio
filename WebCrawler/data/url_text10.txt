In addition to the regular Ghibli-themed exhibitions, the museum also stages temporary exhibitions on an animation theme.

One floor of the exhibition is dedicated entirely to the making of Aardman films, including the Academy Award-winning picture Curse of the directed by Park.
Figures used in Aardman films will be on display.
