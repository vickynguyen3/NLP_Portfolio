## Homework 1: Text Processing with Python
The program processes the text of a file and corrects the format of the employee list. The user will have to input the correct format when
the program has found an error e.g. the phone number 123 234 4567 is in the wrong format and needs to be corrected as 123-234-4567. After the progam has finished correcting the format of the information of the employees. It will output the employee list to show the employee ID, first name, middle name, last name, and phone number

### How to run the program:
py Homework1_vtn180004.py data/data.csv

### Strength and Weakness of Python for Text Processing
The strength of python from what I learned in this assignment is that
it is very high level and makes it easier to search such as the keys() or re.search(). The weakness of Python in my opinion is that there's no declaration for variables so I find it difficult to keep track or hard to find the error. For example, during the assignment I had an error in my code, but I wasn't sure what the error is coming from and
realized it came from my variable not being the same as what I typed in the parameter.

### What I've Learned 
I learned how to use several variations of python functions such as
input(), capititalize, keys(), search(), etc. I learned how to use
dictionary and pickle.
