## Homework 1: Text Processing with Python
The program processes the text of a file and corrects the format of the employee list. The user will need to input the correct format when
the program has found an error. After the progam has finished correcting the format, it will output the employee list to show: employee ID, first name, middle name, last name, and phone #

### How to run the program:
py Homework1_vtn180004.py data/data.csv

### Strength and Weakness
The strength of python is that
it is very high level and makes it easier to search such as the keys() or re.search(). The weakness of Python in my opinion is that there's no declaration for variables so I find it difficult to keep track or hard to find the error. For example, I had an error in my code, but I wasn't sure what the error is coming from and realized it came from my variable not being the same as what I typed in the parameter.

### What I've Learned 
I learned how to utilize several variations of python functions such as
input(), capititalize, keys(), search(), etc. I learned how to use
dictionary and pickle.
